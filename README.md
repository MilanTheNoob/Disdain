# Disdain
An unfinished prototype game featuring mesh procedural generation, an advanced C++ server with custom physics &amp; more.

This has been abandoned in favor of newer & better projects, it still represents a lot of personal achievements & code that I don't want to abandon. The server is a C++ script while the client is a Unity3D project.
